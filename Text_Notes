- Macro programming
- different translation approaches
- existing fri not designed as standalone entails/frame solvers
	e.g. fri assumes that all pure assertions are extracted
- parameterization on member assn as paramter to assertion or locale
- list of llvm_rep + assertions to abstract vs list of abstract
	- same question for mapping for both keys and values 

### sep solver

- efficient focusing method?
- allows dest and intro with multiple prems/concs
