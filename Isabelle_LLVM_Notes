- mising EXTRACT
- reasoning on pure_part of assertions; needs method/rules for extracting and splitting pure parts
- missing fri_extract to convert existential quantification
- to argue on subtrees, rbt assertion must be split up so we can't argue on full tree anymore 
- no error at [llvm_code] declaration, but only at export_llvm
- using "macros" like if! C then! T else! F in partial_function
