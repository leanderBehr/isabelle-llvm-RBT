DONE:
- missing EXTRACT
- automatic unfolding of conclusions in rule applications, equiv to folding premise
- 

TODO:
- reasoning on pure_part of assertions; needs method/rules for extracting and splitting pure parts [search <STATE_extract_pure>]
- reasoning on pure assertions like color_assn is a pain because of different tags

- automate unfolding rbt assn in premise as needed

- have variables as input to rbt assn??

- using "macros" like if! C then! T else! F in partial_function

- missing fri_extract to convert existential quantification

- no error at [llvm_code] declaration, but only at export_llvm
- export_llvm errors are unhelpful
